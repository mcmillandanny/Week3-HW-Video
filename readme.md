# Homework
* Hide the built in video controls
* Change the video to something you enjoy. Read up on encoding, because not all video formats can (or should) be put on the web
* Design your own controls. Have some fun with it.
     * play/pause
	 * time elapsed
	 * time remaining
	 * progress bar
	 * mute/unmute
	 * fullscreen
	 * skip back 10 seconds
* Make the play/pause button actually alternate between play and pause, both visually and functionally.
* Make the mute/unmute button actually alternate between mute and unmute, both visually and functionally.
* Show an up-to-date time elapsed and time remaining
* Make a working progress bar (just the visual; making it draggable is very difficult)

# Bonus
* Add CSS or JS animation between the states of buttons (play to pause, mute to unmute, etc)
* Make the progress bar draggable, so users can jump to specific points in the video
* Make a list of links to important points in the video, like chapters, and have the links jump to those exact times
